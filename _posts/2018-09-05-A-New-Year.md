    <td>During the lesson the most effective methods to learn were perseverance and listening. The first of these, perseverance, came in particular use because even though github wasn't recognising the code I had to keep trying for success. Listening was also helpful as when we introduced to an easier ethod I was able to utilise it.</td>
